/*		VVGL/VVISF have a "GLBuffer" class that represents a GL texture, but including this class will pull in the GLEW headers used by these libs on windows.  there's nothing inherently wrong with this...but when you try to use this with max, you run into a problem: if you include the max headers first, GLEW throws an error (because this would include gl.h before GLEW).  if you include the GLEW headers first, the max headers throw an error because internally one of its defines has the same name as one of GLEW's defines.

that's why this class exists: "MyBuffer" is safe to include and use from the max/jitter code, and it's really just a wrapper around GLBuffer.				*/
